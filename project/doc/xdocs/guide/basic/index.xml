		<p>
			This section walks through the concrete classes provided by <em>JUEL</em>, that make up
			the core of the evaluation process: the factory and the various kinds of expressions it creates.
		</p>
		<p>
			We do not fully cover inherited behavior, which is already described by the API super classes.
			Rather, we focus on additional methods provided by <em>JUEL</em> as extensions to the API as
			well as implementation specific information.
