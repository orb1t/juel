			When creating and evaluating expressions, some other important classes come into play:
			a <code>javax.el.ELContext</code> is required at creation time and evaluation time. It
			contains methods to access a function mapper (<code>javax.el.FunctionMapper</code>), a variable
			mapper (<code>javax.el.VariableMapper</code>) and a resolver (<code>javax.el.ELResolver</code>).
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				At creation time, the context's function mapper and variable mapper are used to bind
				function invocations to static methods and identifiers (variables) to value expressions.
				The context's resolver is <em>not</em> used at creation time.
			</li>
			<li>
				At evaluation time, the context's resolver is used for property resolutions and to resolve
				unbound identifiers (top-level properties).
				The context's function mapper and variable mapper are <em>not</em> used at evaluation time.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<em>JUEL</em> provides simple implementations of these classes to get you using the unified EL
			"out of the box".
